# Steam-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot that I created and hosted on Repl.it to track the ban status of Steam accounts using the steam API.

The reason for creating this was because when me and my friends would play game online we would often play against cheaters and we would always wonder if anything ever happened to those cheaters so I created a bot that we could add the accounts to and have them be checked over.

If there was a cheater that would got banned then the bot would post a discord embed to a server channel and then remove the account from the database.
